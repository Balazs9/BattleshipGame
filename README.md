2. termcolor: to color the text what is printed to the screen, player and computer has different colors, rules and error messages also has different colors

## Testing

The game was tested with all scenarios, given number outside of the range, given other characters also, validator is working correctly checking and giving the suitable warning message

Pep8 online validator for the python code check

## Deployment

- The project was developed and stored in git.

- The source file was regularly pushed to repository GitHub 

- deployed on Heroku, using Code Institute mock terminal

## Credits

- Code Institute for the deployment terminal and the learning materials, videos and exercises.
